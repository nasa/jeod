# JSC Engineering Orbital Dynamics (JEOD)

## Brief Abstract:
The JSC Engineering Orbital Dynamics (JEOD) Software Package is a simulation
tool designed to work with [NASA Trick Simulation Environment](https://github.com/nasa/trick/)
that provides vehicle trajectory generation by the solution of a set of
numerical dynamical models. These models are subdivided into four categories.
There are Environment models representing the conditions surrounding the
vehicle, Dynamics models for integrating the equations of motion, Interaction
models representing vehicle interactions with the environment, and a set of
mathematical and orbital dynamics Utility models.

JEOD is designed to simulate spacecraft trajectories in flight regimes ranging
from low Earth orbit to lunar operations, interplanetary trajectories, and other
deep space missions. JEOD can be used to simulate a stand-alone spacecraft
trajectory and attitude state, or it can be interfaced with a larger simulation
space, such as coupling with spacecraft effectors and guidance, navigation and
control systems. More than one spacecraft can be simulated about one central
body or separate spacecraft about separate central bodies.
