@section other_docs Additional Documentation

Key features that distinguish the current release, build instructions,
and a history of JEOD are described in the \ref readme "JEOD README file".

The main documentation for JEOD is in the form of pdf files.
These pdf files collectively form JSC-61777, "JSC Engineering Orbital Dynamics".
This documentation tree is headed by the
<a href="../../docs/JEOD.pdf">JEOD toplevel document</a>.

Each model is accompanied with a document named \<model_name\>.pdf, where
where \<model_name\> is the name of the model. This document describes the
requirements, design, usage, and testing of the model.
See the \ref modeldocs "Model Documents" page for a list of the
model documentation files.

JEOD provides several other documents in addition to the toplevel document
and the model documents. These include descriptions of the JEOD-wide
verification and validation simulations and tutorials.
See the \ref topleveldocs "Toplevel Documents" page for a list of these
additional documentation files.


@section dependency_diagrams Dependency Diagrams

Ensuring that the initialization, scheduled, and derivative jobs are called
in the proper order can be a challenging task. The various simulations packaged
with JEOD can serve as an exemplar for achieving this task.
The diagrams and dot files listed below depict the dependencies in the
dynamics comparison simulation
(\ref dyncomp_sdefine "click to see the S_define"):
 - Initialization jobs:
   <a href="../../verif/SIM_dyncomp/docs/tex/figs/initialization.png">
