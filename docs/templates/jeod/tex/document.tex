\section{Document Production}
\label{sec:doc_production}
The \dynenv package provides three macros that simplify the specification of a
document, |frontmatter|, |mainmatter|, and |backmatter|. These macros write
the front matter, main matter, and back matter of a JEOD document.

\subsection{The Structure of a JEOD Document}
All JEOD document must have:
\begin{itemize}
\item Front matter than comprises:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The cover pages,
  \item An abstract or executive summary,
  \item A table of contents, and
  \item Optional lists of figures and tables.
  \end{itemize}
\item Body matter that comprises five chapters labeled:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Introduction,
  \item Product Requirements,
  \item Product Specification,
  \item User Guide, and
  \item Inspections, Tests, and Metrics.
  \end{itemize}
  Details regarding the contents of these chapters is specified elsewhere.
  Documents that have multiple parts should have these five chapters
  in each part.
\item Back matter that comprises:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Optional appendices, and
  \item A bibliography.
  \end{itemize}
  The bibliography is constructed automatically from the references in the
  document, the JEOD \BibTeX\ file, and the model-specific \BibTeX\ file.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Front Matter}
The \command{frontmatter} macro constructs the front matter. The macro takes
one optional and one mandatory argument.
\begin{codeblock}
\frontmatter[options]{abstractOrSummary}
\end{codeblock}
The options are a comma-separated list of elements of the form
|key=value| or just |key|. The keys are:
\begin{description}
\item[\option{style=<style>}] Specifies whether the document summary is written
  using the abstract environment or as an unnumbered chapter.
  Use |style=abstract| for the former, |style=summary| for the latter.
\item[\option{label=<name>}]Specifies the PDF label of the summary.
This option is only needed when the summary is written as an unnumbered chapter
and the name of that chapter is something other than ``Executive Summary.''
\item[\option{figures}] Causes the list of figures to be generated.
\item[\option{tables}] Causes the list of tables to be generated.
\end{description}
Note: The optional argument is not completely optional.
You must specify the |style|.

The mandatory argument specifies the name of the file (sans the |.tex| suffix)
the contains the abstract or summary.

\subsubsection{Sample Usage}
The following generates front matter with a list of tables (but no list of
figures) with the abstract contained in the file |ModelAbstract.tex|.
\begin{codeblock}
\frontmatter[style=abstract,tables]{ModelAbstract}
\end{codeblock}

The next example generates front matter with a list of figures and a list of
tables with an executive summary contained in the file |summary.tex|.
\begin{codeblock}
\frontmatter[style=summary,figures,tables]{summary}
\end{codeblock}

The final example generates front matter with no list of figures or list of
tables with an abstract in |chapter*| form contained in the file |abstract.tex|.
\begin{codeblock}
\frontmatter[style=summary,label=Abstract]{abstract}
\end{codeblock}

\subsubsection{Abstract or Executive Summary?}
The purpose of the abstract or executive summary is to inform the reader of
the relevance of the subject of the document to some problem the reader needs
to solve. This preface to the document should clearly but concisely summarize
the subject of the document.

Use an abstract if this summary description is very brief, four or five
paragraphs at most. An abstract cannot contain any sectioning commands.
Longer descriptions that need some internal structure should be written in an
executive summary form.

An executive summary can be considerably longer than four or five paragraphs
but should never be  more than 10\% of the document as a whole.
An executive summary must at a minimum start with a |\chapter*| command and may
contain |\section*| and lower level sectioning commands. Always use the starred
form of the sectioning commands in an executive summary.
While the outline of the main matter is highly structured, this is not the
case for an executive summary. You don't need no stinkin' requirements,
for example. Write in a manner that best summarizes the material.

\subsubsection{Sample Abstract}

The following sample abstract summarizes the fictitious psychoceramics model.

\begin{codeblock}
\begin{abstract}
The cracked pot interaction, first investigated by Josiah S. Carberry, is
typically a small perturbative force in spacecraft dynamics. Refinements of
the interaction have been proposed over the years by a number of authors.
Future developments in this field may well revolutionize space flight.
This is the golden age of psychoceramics! The Psychoceramics Model
implements models of several of the more promising of these techniques.
\end{abstract}
\end{codeblock}

Assuming the above is the contents of the |abstract.tex| file in the |docs/tex|
directory of the psychoceramics model, the toplevel |psychoceramics.tex| file could include this abstract via
\begin{codeblock}
\frontmatter[style=abstract,tables]{abstract}
\end{codeblock}


\subsubsection{Sample Executive Summary}

The executive summary form of the preface provides a more detailed
(but still summary) description of the subject matter. An executive summary
for the above fictitious model is presented below.

\begin{codeblock}
\chapter*{Executive Summary}
\section*{Overview}
The cracked pot interaction, first investigated by Josiah S. Carberry, is
typically a small perturbative force in spacecraft dynamics. Refinements of
the interaction have been proposed over the years by a number of authors.
Future developments in this field may well revolutionize space flight.
This is the golden age of psychoceramics! The Psychoceramics Model
implements models of several of the more promising of these techniques.

\section*{Implemented Interactions}
A wide variety of interactions are implemented in the model, far too many to
enumerate in this introductory note. One of the more interesting is the
application of Bell's inequality to a vehicle at 37.235163 north latitude,
115.810645 west longitude on the 91st day of the year (92nd in leap years).
For other interactions provided by the model, users are advised to RTFC.

\section*{Implementation Techniques}
A variety of innovative programming techniques were employed to model the
more esoteric aspects of psychoceramics. The model makes extensive use of
obfuscatory techniques, several of which have been featured in the IOCCC.
Multiple virtual protected inheritance, quadruple dispatch, nondeterministic
behavior, and operator re-re-overloading are heavily employed. The model
explores the deepest and darkest corners of metaprogramming, and implements
features that hitherto have been lost since the days of INTERCAL and APL.
\end{codeblock}

Assuming the above is the contents of the |summary.tex| file in the |docs/tex|
directory of the psychoceramics model, the toplevel |psychoceramics.tex| file could include this executive summary via
\begin{codeblock}
\frontmatter[style= summary,tables]{summary}
\end{codeblock}


\subsection{Main Matter}
The \command{mainmatter} macro constructs the body matter. The macro
takes a single argument, a comma-separated list of files to be |\input|.
One approach to organizing the document content is to have one master file
that encapsulates all of the body content. For example, with the body
matter encapsulated in the file |ModelBody.tex|, one would use the following
to build the body of the document:
\begin{codeblock}
\mainmatter{ModelBody}
\end{codeblock}
Another approach is to place each of the five chapters in its own |.tex|
file. For example, if these five files are |intro.tex|, |reqt.tex|, |spec.tex|,
|guide.tex|, and |ivv.tex|, one would use the following
to build the body of the document:
\begin{codeblock}
\mainmatter{intro,reqt,spec,guide,ivv}
\end{codeblock}

\subsubsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:chapterone}
The first chapter of the document introduces the subject of the document
in a structured way. This chapter comprises four sections:
\begin{description}
\item[1.1 (Purpose and Objectives):] Brief description of the subject matter.
\item[1.2 (Context within JEOD):] Context of the subject matter within JEOD.
\item[1.3 (Document History):] History of the document.
\item[1.4 (Document Organization):] Table of contents in text form.
\end{description}
The bulk of this chapter is standard across almost all model documents.
Only sections 1.1 (purpose and objectives) and 1.3 (document history) are
document-specific.

The macro |\boilerplatechapterone| constructs this first chapter.
The macro takes two arguments, the contents of section 1.1 (purpose and objectives) and the table entries for section 1.3 (history). Example:

\begin{codeblock}
\boilerplatechapterone{
  The cracked pot interaction, first investigated by Josiah S. Carberry, is
  typically a small perturbative force in spacecraft dynamics. Refinements of
  the interaction have been proposed over the years by a number of authors.
  Future developments in this field may well revolutionize space flight.
  This is the golden age of psychoceramics! The Psychoceramics Model
  implements models of several of the more promising of these techniques.}
{
  \ModelHistory
}
\end{codeblock}

In the above example, the first argument is the first paragraph from the
executive summary. The second paragraph is the |\ModelHistory| command,
presumably defined in the model-specific .sty file.
See section~\ref{sec:model.sty}.


\subsubsection{Product Requirements}
\label{sec:chaptertwo}
Unlike the other four chapters, the requirements chapter has no sections.
It comprises one requirement after another.
Example:
\begin{codeblock}
\requirement{Flux Capacitor}
\label{reqt:1.21gigawatts}
\begin{description:}
\item[Requirement]
 The model shall simulate the behavior of a vehicle outfitted with a
 flux capacitor connected to a 1.21 gigawatt power source
 as the vehicle crosses the 88 MPH threshold.
\item[Rationale]
This capability is needed by the BTTF simulation group.
\item[Verification]
Inspection, test
\end{description:}
\end{codeblock}

\subsubsection{Product Specification}
\label{sec:chapterthree}
The product specification chapter of the document introduces the subject of the document
in a structured way. This chapter comprises four sections:
\begin{description}
\item[3.1 (Conceptual Design):] This section provides
a conceptual description of the model.
This section typically provides answers to the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item What are the key concepts of the model?
\item What is the model architecture?
\item What drove the design of the model?
\end{itemize}

\item[3.2 (Mathematical Formulations):] This section summarizes
the mathematics employed by the model.

In the case of a mathematics-free computer science model,
this section should be named "Key Algorithms."
\item[3.3 (Interactions):] Describes how the model interacts with
other JEOD models and other external agents.
\item[3.4 (Detailed Design):] Details on the design.
\item[3.5 (Inventory):] Details on the design.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{User Guide}
\label{sec:chapterfour}
\begin{description}
\item[4.1 (Instructions for Simulation Users):] Broad description of classes, key design concepts, etc.
\item[4.2 (Instructions for Simulation Developers):] Broad description of classes, key design concepts, etc.
\item[4.3 (Instructions for Model Developers):] Broad description of classes, key design concepts, etc.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Inspections, Tests, and Metrics}
\label{sec:chapterfive}
\begin{description}
\item[5.1 (Inspections):] Broad description of classes, key design concepts, etc.
\item[5.2 (Tests):] Broad description of classes, key design concepts, etc.
\item[5.3 (Requirements Traceability):] Broad description of classes, key design concepts, etc.
\item[5.4 (Metrics):] Broad description of classes, key design concepts, etc.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Multi-part Documents}
Word.

\subsection{Back Matter}
The \command{backmatter} macro constructs the back matter.
The macro takes one optional and one mandatory argument.
\begin{quote}
|\backmatter[options]{appendices}|
\end{quote}
The options are a comma-separated list of elements of the form
|key=value| or just |key|. The keys are:
\begin{description}
\item[\option{bibpos=<pos>}] Specifies whether the bibliography
is placed before (|pos=start|) or after (|pos=end|) the appendices.
\item[\option{modelbibfile=<name>}] Specifies the name of the model-specific
|.bib| file. This option is needed only in the case that the model author
has not followed the recommended practice of naming the model-specific
|.bib| file after the model.
\item[\option{nomodelbibfile}] Specifies that there is no model-specific
|.bib| file.
\end{description}

The mandatory argument specifies the names of the files (sans the |.tex| suffix)
the build the appendices.
Use an empty argument '{}' if the model has no appendices.

\subsection{Document Directory Files}
\subsubsection{Makefile}
\subsubsection{Model-Specific Package}\label{sec:model.sty}
when the \dynenv package is operating in |complete| mode,
it loads the model-specific
package file via |\RequirePackage{\MODELNAME}|

One such place where the \dynenv package uses one of names defined in
|paths.def| is the very next operation the \dynenv package performs
when the package is operating in |complete| mode: It loads the model-specific
package file via |\RequirePackage{\MODELNAME}|. For a model document that
is built following the recommended practice, the model-specific
package file must define the following:
\begin{description}
\item[\command{ModelRevision}] The revision number of the model document.\\
  This should be incremented in some manner when the contents of the model
  document are updated. It is recommended that this definition be placed very
  close to the start of the model-specific package to ease the update process.
\item[\command{ModelAuthor}] The name or names of the people who wrote the
  current revision of the model.\\
  The |\ModelAuthor| is used to generate the inside cover and
  is stored as the PDF author of the document.
  Multiple authors, if present, must be separated by newlines (|\\|).
\item[\command{ModelPrefix}] A one word name of the model.\\
  The |\ModelPrefix| is used to label the requirements, inspections, and tests
  that are specified in the model's |.tex| files.
\item[\command{ModelDesc}] A short description of the model.\\
  The |\ModelDesc| is stored as the PDF description of the document.
\item[\command{ModelKeywords}] A comma-separated list of keywords.\\
  The |\ModelKeywords| are stored as the PDF keywords of the document.
\end{description}

It is recommended that the document history also be stored in the model-specific
package file as the command \command{ModelHistory}. This practice places the
document revision number and history in close proximity, thereby easing update.
The command should define a list of table entries, newest to oldest.
Each entry must be of the form |Author & Date & Revision & Description \\|.
The fields are:
\begin{description}
\item[Author]       The authors responsible for the current document revision.
\item[Date]         The month and year of the document revision.
\item[Revision]     The document revision number in major.minor format.
\item[Description]  A brief description of why the revision was made.
\end{description}

A sample model-specific style file follows for the fictitious
psychoceramics model.
