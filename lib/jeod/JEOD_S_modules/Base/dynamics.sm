DynamicsSimObject
Purpose:( This version of the JEOD dynamics object enables initialization
          as well as runtime body actions and state integration for a
          single integration group.)
Assumptions:
 *  DYNAMICS represents the time interval between calls to environment-class
             jobs, and should be defined in the S_define according to the needs
             of the simulation
 * Order dependencies:  This file must be included after including the
             default priority settings file and the time S-module.
