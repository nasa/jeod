/**
 * BodyAction is the base class for the BodyAction model.
 * A BodyAction instance that performs some operation on a MassBody object.
 * The simulation Dynamics Manager object manages a collection of BodyAction
 * objects for the purpose of initializing MassBody objects and later, for
 * performing asynchronous actions on them.
 *
 * The BodyAction model hinges on three methods:
 * - initialize()
 *   The initialize() method initializes the BodyAction.
 *   This method does not and must not operate on the subject of the action.
 *   All derived classes must forward the initialize() call to the immediate
 *   parent class and then perform class-dependent object initializations.
 * - is_ready()
 *   The is_ready method indicates whether the action is ready to be applied.
 *   For example, an action that initializes the translation state of a
 *   vehicle relative to some other vehicle cannot do its job until that
 *   other vehicle's translational state is set. The is_ready() method for such
 *   an action should return false until the other vehicle's translational
 *   state has been set.
 * - apply()
 *   The apply() method applies the action -- it does something to the subject
 *   of the action.
 *   All derived classes must perform class-dependent actions and then
 *   must forward the apply() call to the immediate parent class.
