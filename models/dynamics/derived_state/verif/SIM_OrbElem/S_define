PURPOSE:
This is a demonstration sim for the Orbital Elements Derived State model.

The following simulation objects are defined in this sim:

         sys - Trick runtime executive and data recording routines
    jeod_sys - JEOD system object
   jeod_time - JEOD time object
    dynamics - The dynamics manager
         env - Environment: ephemeris, gravity initialization
       earth - Managing Earth
         veh - The vehicle

==============================================================================*/
