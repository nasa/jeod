/*========================== TRICK HEADER ======================================
PURPOSE:
This is a demonstration sim for the Relative Derived State model.

The following simulation objects are defined in this sim:

         sys - Trick runtime executive and data recording routines
    jeod_sys - JEOD system object
   jeod_time - JEOD time object
    dynamics - The dynamics manager
        vehA - One vehicle
        vehB - Another vehicle
   rel_state - state between vehicles.
==============================================================================*/

// Define job calling intervals
#define DYNAMICS        1.00  // Moon/orbital dynamics interval
