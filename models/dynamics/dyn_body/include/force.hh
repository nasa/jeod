 * A Force represents a Newtonian force that acts on a DynBody.

 * structural frame of that DynBody object.
 *
 * The Force class is the recommended mechanism for representing forces in JEOD.
 * While 3-vectors can also be collected into a collect STL vector, theee is
 * is no way to turn off these collected 3-vectors. Even worse, there is no way
 * to tell whether a collected 3-vector does indeed represent a force -- or
 * even if it is a 3-vector. In comparison, Force objects can be turned on and
 * off, and more importantly, they are type-safe.
