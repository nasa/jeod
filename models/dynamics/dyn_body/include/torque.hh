 * A Torque represents a Newtonian torque that acts on a DynBody.
 * The class encapsulates an active flag and a 3-vector that contains the
 * torque components. Torques are collected in one of a DynBody object's
 * torque collection STL vectors. The torque vector is expressed in the
 * structural frame of that DynBody object.
 *
 * The Torque class is the recommended mechanism for representing torques in
 * JEOD. While 3-vectors can also be collected into a collect STL vector,
 * theee is is no way to turn off these collected 3-vectors. Even worse, there
 * is no way to tell whether a collected 3-vector does indeed represent a
 * torque, or even if it is a 3-vector. In comparison, Torque objects can be
 * turned on and off, and more importantly, they are type-safe.
