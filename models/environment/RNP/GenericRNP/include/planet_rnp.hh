Purpose:

Reference:
  (((David A. Vallado)
    (Fundamentals of Astrodynamics and Applications, Third Edition)

Assumptions and limitations:
  ((This framework is limited to models which are of the form:
    celestial frame = Precession * Nutation *
                      Rotation * Polar Motion * terestrial frame
    When the entire model is updated, it will be updated:
    Precession - Nutation - Rotation - Polar Motion
    This is important when individual models are inter-related
    This can be overriden by an inheriting class, if so needed
    ))
