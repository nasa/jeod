/**
 * An EphemerisRefFrame is a RefFrame whose state is set by an ephemeris model.
 * Ephemeris reference frames come in three basic flavors:
 * - Planet-centered inertial frames. These are non-rotating frames whose
 *   origin is the center of mass of some planet (the Sun is a planet)
 *   and whose translational motion is (for now) assumed to be due to
 *   gravitation only. The orientation with respect to inertial is the
 *   identity transformation.
 * - Barycenter inertial frames. These are non-rotating frames whose origin
 *   is the center of mass of two or more planets.
 * - Planet-fixed frames. These are rotating frames whose origin is the
 *   center of mass of some planet (see ISSUE) and that rotate with the
 *   planet in question. The parent is always a planet-centered inertial
 *   frame with a zero translation offset between the planet-centered
 *   inertial and planet-fixed frames.
 *
 * Only planet-centered inertial and barycenter inertial frames can serve
 * as integration frames or as the root of the reference frame tree.
