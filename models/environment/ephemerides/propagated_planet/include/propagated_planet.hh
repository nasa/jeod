 * ephemeris model that owns the item, is responsible for maintaining the
 * translational state of the target frame when the item is enabled but not when
 * the item is disabled.
 *
 * For this class, when the enabled flag is set still means that the item is
 * responsible for maintaining the  translational state of the target ephemeris
 * reference frame. The dynamic body serves as the source of this state.
 * When the enabled flag is clear, some other model is assumed to be responsible
 * for maintaining the target frame state. The target frame state serves as the
 * source of the dynamic body's state when the enabled flag is clear.

 * The PropagatedPlanet ephemeris model provides planetary state via a DynBody
 * object whose state is propagated using the JEOD state integration techniques.
 * Scenarios in which a simulation will use a PropagatedPlanet object include:
 * - An object such as an asteroid for which an ephemeris model is not readily
 *   available.
 * - An object such as a planet that is represented in some other ephemeris
 *   model but the simulation developer wants the planet to be propagated to
 *   ensure that the planet and the vehicles operating in the vicinity of the
 *   planet obey the same laws of physics.
 *
 * The PropagatedPlanet model provides mechanisms that accommodate these
 * scenarios. The class defines multiple modes in which a propagated planet
 * planet object operates. In all modes, the model ensures consistency between
 * the translational states of the dynamic body's composite frame and the
 * planet's planet-centered frame and between the rotational states of the
 * dynamic body's composite frame and the planet's planet-fixed frame.
