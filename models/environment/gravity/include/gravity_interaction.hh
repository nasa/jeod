 * Define the GravityInteraction class, used to represent the gravitational
 * interaction betweens a DynBody and a set of planetary bodies. Note that while
 * each DynBody instance has a GravityInteraction data member, this class is
 * defined as a part of the gravity model rather than the dyn_body model.
 * This is because the coupling between this class and the other parts of the
 * gravity model is much stronger than the coupling between this class and
 * the dyn_body model.
