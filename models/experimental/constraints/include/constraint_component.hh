/**
 * Represents a single scalar constraint, either a pure force in a specific
 * direction at a specific point or a pure torque in a specific direction,
 * that acts on some vehicle.

 * The force or torque on the vehicle is some scalar value times the direction
 * in which the force/torque acts. The force/torque the vehicle exerts on
 * the constraint body in this direction is the additive inverse of the
 * force/torque the constraint body exerts the vehicle. The behavior of the
 * constraint body can also be described as some function of the total forces
 * and torques on the vehicle (external and constraints), plus inertial effects.
 * This leads to an equation for the scalar constraint force/torque value for
 * each constraint.
 *
 * The class DynBodyConstraintsSolver builds and then solves a system of
 * equations for all of the constrained bodies. This yields values for each
 * of the constraints, and hence for the total constraint forces and torques
 * on the vehicle.
