 * Represents a linear system of equations, A*x = b, where A is conceptually
 * an NxN matrix, and x and b are conceptually N-vectors. This class
 * solves for x in A*x = b. How it does that is up to a derived class.
 * `solve` is pure virtual in this base class template.
 *
 * An implementor of an instantiable derived class of this class template
 * must implement the `solve` method.
 *
 * A user of this class template
 *  - Sets the number of degrees of freedom N,
 *  - Populates the A matrix and b vector, and
 *  - Requests the object to solve for x.
 *
 * Users must not assume that `solve` leaves the populated A matrix and b vector
 * untouched. To the contrary, an instantiable solver might well modify these
 * elements in the process of solving the matrix equation. It is up to the user
 * to fully populate the A matrix and b vector prior to calling `solve`.
