/*******************************************************************************
 * This file defines a common version of the JEOD dynamics sim object.
 * This version of the JEOD dynamics object enables initialization as well as
 * runtime body actions.
 *
 * The following preprocessor symbols must be #defined:
 * - PENV
 *   The Trick phase during which the dynamics manager itself is initialized.
 * - PBODY
 *   The phase during which the dynamics manager initializes dynamic bodies.
 * - PGRAV
 *   A moderately high phase number that ensures gravitation is called late
 *   in the derivative process, after planetary rotations have been updated.
 * - DYNAMICS
 *   The time interval between calls to environment-class jobs.
 *
 * Order dependencies:
 * This file must be included after the including the time S-module but before
 * including the environment S-module.
