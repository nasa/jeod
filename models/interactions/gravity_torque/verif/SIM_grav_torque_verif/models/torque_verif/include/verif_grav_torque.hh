PURPOSE:
   (Single Rigid Body Gravity Gradient Torque Computation)

REFERENCE:
   (((Hughes, Peter) (Spacecraft Attitude Dynamics)
     (Dover Publications) (2004) (Pages 281-346) (ISBN:0-486-43925-9)))

ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS:
   ((Uniform mass distribution)
    (Inertia tensor input is referenced to the composite body frame)
    (Spherical Planet)
    (Position vector is inertial referenced)
    (Symmetric Inertia tensor - only upper diagonal is used)
    (Output torques are structural frame referenced about the composite C.G.))

CLASS:
   (derivative)

LIBRARY DEPENDENCY:
   ((../src/verif_grav_torque.cc))
