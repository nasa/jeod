// PURPOSE:
//==============================================================================
// This simulation is a demonstration simulation for the JEOD2.0 implementation
// of the radiation-thermal module.
//
// The following simulation objects are defined in this sim:
//
//         sys   - Trick runtime executive and data recording routines
//         time  - Universal time
//         mngr  - the dynamics manager
//         env   - the environment definition
//         sun   - the sun definition
//         earth - the earth definition
//         moon  - the moon definition
//         vehicle - the vehicle definition
//         radiation - radiation-thermal model, using a surface
//
//==============================================================================
