 * @file models/utils/memory/include/jeod_alloc.hh
 * Define JEOD memory allocation macros.
 *
 * The jeod_alloc.hh memory macros can be viewed as
 *  - Being externally-usable or for internal use only.@n
 *    The supported use of the JEOD memory model is via those macros
 *    advertised as externally-usable. These externally-usable macros expand
 *    into invocations of internal macros, which in turn expand into calls to
 *    methods of classes defined in the memory model.
 *    Those macros marked as internal are for internal use only by this file.
 *  - Supporting allocation versus deletion.@n
 *    Some of the jeod_alloc.hh memory macros allocate memory while others
 *    delete it. With one exception, the allocation/delete nature of a macro
 *    is explicit in the macro name. Allocation macros start with JEOD_ALLOC.
 *    Macros that address deleting memory start with JEOD_DELETE.
 *  - Operating on objects versus arrays.@n
 *    The memory management macros come in two basic forms: ARRAY and OBJECT.
 *    Memory allocated with an ARRAY allocator macro must be freed with
 *    JEOD_DELETE_ARRAY. Memory allocated with an OBJECT allocator macro
 *    must be freed with JEOD_DELETE_OBJECT. This corresponds to the C++
 *    distiction between operator new[], delete[], new, and delete.
 *  - Operating on structured versus non-structured data.@n
 *    The JEOD memory model registers allocated memory with the underlying
 *    simulation engine (e.g., Trick). To make the data in a structured type
 *    visible to the engine, the user must declare an external reference to
 *    the engine's description of the type.
 *    For example, to allocate an instance of some class Foo using the
 *    default constructor use@code
 *      JEOD_DECLARE_ATTRIBUTES (Foo)
 *      ...
 *       Foo * foo_obj = JEOD_ALLOC_CLASS (Foo, ());@endcode
 *    See \ref JEOD_DECLARE_ATTRIBUTES.
 *
 * Two compile -D options affect the behavior of these macros. These are
 *  - JEOD_MEMORY_DEBUG - The memory model debugging level.
 *    The debugging level ranges from 0 (off) to 3 (all transactions).
 *    If this is not set in the compile flags the value is set to 0 (off).
 *  - JEOD_MEMORY_GUARD - Guards will be added around allocated memory
 *    if this option is defined and has a non-zero value.
