/**
 * This class provides the interface between the macros in jeod_alloc.hh and
 * the rest of the JEOD memory model.
 * The public interface is via the publicly visible static methods.
 * All nonstatic member functions are private.
 * Each public static method relays the method call to the singleton memory
 * manager via a correspondingly named private member function.
 *
 * \par Singleton
 * The class is intended to be a singleton.
 * The private static member JeodMemoryManager::Master points to this
 * singular instance. The constructor sets that static member if it is null.
 * The constructor issues a non-fatal error when multiple instances of the
 * class are created.
 *
 * \par Thread Safety
 * This class contains objects that must be accessed and updated in a
 * thread-safe manner. The member data that must be used atomically are
 *  - JeodMemoryManager::alloc_table - Maps memory addresses to memory items
 *  - JeodMemoryManager::type_table - Maps RTTI names to type descriptors
 *  - JeodMemoryManager::string_table - Maps unique strings to themselves.
 *  - JeodMemoryManager::cur_data_size - Current size of allocated data.
 *  - JeodMemoryManager::max_data_size - Maximum of the above.
 *  - JeodMemoryManager::max_table_size - Maximum allocation table size.
 *  - JeodMemoryManager::allocation_number - Number of allocations made.
 * \par
 * To ensure the constraint is satisfied, access to the these elements is
 * protected by means of a mutex and is limited to a small number of methods.
 * A pair of methods, JeodMemoryManager::begin_atomic_block and
 * JeodMemoryManager::end_atomic_block systematize the use of the mutex.
 * The methods that operate on the protected data are
 *  - Constructor and destructor.@n
 *    The constructor operates on the protected data before it creates the
 *    mutex and marks the JeodMemoryManager object as usable. The destructor
 *    marks the object as unusable and destroys the mutex before operating
 *    on the protected data.
 *  - JeodMemoryManager::generate_shutdown_report, which is called by the
 *    destructor after it has destroyed the mutex.
 *  - Methods whose names end with _atomic. These methods use the
 *    begin_atomic_block / end_atomic_block paradigm to ensure that the
 *    operations are carried out atomically.
 *  - Methods whose names end with _nolock. These methods operate on protected
 *    data but do so without atomic protection. These methods are called
 *    only by _atomic methods from within their atomic protection block.
 *
 * \par Forbidden Word - Mutable
 * The data member JeodMemoryManager::mutex is mutable, a forbidden word
 * per the JEOD coding standards. The coding standards allow for waivers to
 * the standards if the exception is justified. This section provides the
 * explanation needed to enable the use of that word in this case.
 * \par
 * The @a mutable keyword tells the compiler to ignore modifications to
 * mutable elements in an otherwise @a const method. The @a mutex is mutable
 * because, athough its value does change with a successful lock, it is restored
 * to its prelock value with an unlock. A method that could otherwise qualify
 * as a const method can still be a const method by marking the mutex as
 * mutable. Mutexes are one of the well-accepted types of data that typically
 * marked as mutable.
 *
 * \par Assumptions and Constraints on the Simulation Developer
 * This class places restrictions on the simulation developer.
 *  - The simulation's MessageHandler object must be constructed prior
 *    to constructing the simulation's JeodMemoryManager object.
 *  - The simulation's MessageHandler object must not be destroyed prior
 *    to constructing the simulation's JeodMemoryManager object.
 *  - The simulation's JeodMemoryManager object must be constructed prior to
 *    invoking any of the JEOD_ALLOC_xxx macros in other models.
 *  - The simulation's JeodMemoryManager object must not be destroyed before
 *    other models release their allocated memory.
 * \par
 * The recommended solution is to create an instance of a compliant
 * SimulationInterface before creating any other models and to destroy
 * that SimulationInterface object after destroying all other models.
 * A simple way to achieve this in a Trick-07 simulation is to define a
 * Trick sim object that contains a TrickSimulationInterface element and
 * to place this sim object immediately after the sys sim object.
 *
 * \par Assumptions and Constraints on the Simulation Engine
 * This class makes certain assumptions of the behavior of the simulation
 * engine.
 *  - The simulation engine will not spawn threads that use the JEOD memory
 *    model to allocate memory until after the SimulationInterface object has
 *    been constructed.
 *  - The simulation engine will join all threads that use the JEOD memory
 *    model prior to destroying the SimulationInterface object.
 * \par
 * The Trick-07 and Trick-10 simulation engines satisfies these constraints.
 *
 * \par Assumptions and Constraints on the Simulation Developer
 * This class places certain limitations on the architecture of a JEOD-based
 * simulation.
 *  - The JeodMemoryManager destructor uses the simulation's message handler
 *    to report errors discovered during destruction and may eventually use
 *    the simulation's simulation engine memory interface to revoke the
 *    registration of memory allocated by JEOD that has not been freed.
 *    This in turn means that:
 *    -- The simulation's message handler and simulation engine memory
 *       interface must be destructed after destructing the memory manager.
 *    -- The destructors for those objects cannot use the memory manager.
 *  - The JEOD memory allocation and deallocation macros expand into calls
 *    to memory manager methods. The memory manager must be viable (post
 *    construction, pre destruction) for these calls to function properly.
 *    This in turn means that the memory manager must be constructed very
 *    early in the overall construction process and destructed very late in
 *    in the overall destruction process.
 *  - The supported solution to both of these issues is to use a compliant
 *    derived class of the JeodSimulationInterface class and to ensure that
 *    this composite object created early and destroyed late. In a Trick-07
 *    simulation, this can be accomplished simply by placing a declaration of
 *    an object of type JeodTrickSimInterface near the top of an S_define file.
 *    The recommended placement is just after the Trick system sim object.
