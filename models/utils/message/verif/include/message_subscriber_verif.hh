    PURPOSE:
        (Create a message subscriber that prints the message contents to file
         without including the header. The header includes unique timestamps
         which prevents comparing against verification output on a one-to-one
         basis.)

    Library dependencies:
        ((../src/message_subscriber_verif.cc))
