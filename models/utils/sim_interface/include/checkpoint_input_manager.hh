/**
 A SectionedInputStream is a std::istream that reads from a section in a
 checkpoint file. This class will indicate EOF when the input pointer in the
 checkpoint file file buffer goes beyond the end of the section.

 This is a barebones implementation. It does not provide buffering, it does
 not support seek and tell, and it does not support putback or unget.

 @par Usage
 A SectionedInputStream object is used in a preload_checkpoint or restart
 job to read and then act on contents stored in a checkpoint file.
 @code
 return_type function_name (
    SomeStructureType & stuff_to_restore)
 {
    std::string section_name;
    double number;
    char c_style_line[256];
    std::string cpp_line;
    char character;
    int char_as_int;

    std::string section_name;
    // Set to name of the checkpoint section

    // Construct a checkpoint input stream.
    // Notes:
    // - This object must go out of scope by the end of the job.
    // - DO NOT make a copy of this object.
    // - DO NOT save a pointer to this object in a permanent structure.
    // - The code below assumes that function_name is called as a
    //   preload_checkpoint or a restart job.
   SectionedInputStream reader (
      JeodSimulationInterface::get_checkpoint_reader(section_name));

   // Activate the reader.
   // Fail to do so and you'll get EOF on the first read.
   reader.activate();

   // You can use the C++ operator >> to read various kinds of data ...
   reader >> number;

   // ... even data structures if the structure has a deserializer.
   reader >> stuff_to_restore;

   // Lines can be read with the getline member or std::getline global.
   reader.getline (c_style_line, 255);
   std::getline (reader, cpp_line);

   // Individual characters can be read in a variety of ways.
   reader >> std::noskipws >> character;
   reader.get (character);
   char_as_int = reader.rdbuf()->sbumpc();

   // A bunch of numbers can be read using operator >>:
   while (!! (reader >> number)) {
      stuff_to_restore.add_number (number);
   }

   // An alternative is to implicitly use operator void*:
   while (reader >> number) {
      stuff_to_restore.add_number (number);
   }

   // The file can be scanned via getline, here using the bang-bang trick:
   while (!! std::getline (reader, cpp_string)) {
      process_line (cpp_string);
   }

   // Same as the above, but implicitly using operator void*:
   while (std::getline (reader, cpp_string)) {
      process_line (cpp_string);
   }

   // The file can be processed a character at a time.
   // Once again, either the bang-bang trick or operator void* can be
   // used to check for EOF.
   while (!! std::get (reader, character)) {
      stuff_to_restore.add_char (character);
   }

   // Yet another alternative is to test for EOF using sbumpc:
   while ((char_as_int = rdbuf->sbumpc()) != EOF) {
      stuff_to_restore.add_char ((char)char_as_int);
   }

   // Or use sgetc/sbumpc if the above grates too much:
   while (reader.rdbuf->sgetc()) != EOF) {
      stuff_to_restore.add_char ((char)reader.rdbuf()->sbumpc());
   }
 }
 @endcode

 @par Diagnosing problems
  - Nothing is being read.
    This can be caused by several problems, described below.
  - Is the JEOD checkpoint file open for input?\n
    Checkpoint file sections can only be read from a JEOD checkpoint file
    that is open for input. In a Trick context, the checkpoint file is only
    open for preload_checkpoint and restart jobs. Reading from a checkpoint
    file in other contexts won't work.
  - Are multiple threads trying to read from the same checkpoint file?\n
    Don't do that. This package is not thread-safe.
  - Have you cached some another active checkpoint reader somewhere?\n
    Don't do that, either. Only one reader can be active at a time.
  - Is the checkpoint file section in the checkpoint file?\n
    You will get a diagnostic message if the section doesn't exist.
  - Is the checkpoint reader viable?\n
    The above problems will result in a non-viable checkpoint reader.
    The method is_activatable() can be called prior to calling activate()
    to check whether the stream is viable.
  - Did you call reader.activate()?\n
    Whether compilers make two different objects in the construction of the
    SectionedInputStream or just one object depends on the compiler and on the
    optimization level. Making the package robustly handle the complexities of
    RVO (return value optimization) was too much for the author of the package.
    The call to reader.activate() is essential.
  - Did the call to reader.activate() work?\n
    The method activate() returns true or false to indicate success or failure.
    While the above code did not check status, doing so is a good idea.
  - Did you call reader.deactivate()?\n
    Don't do that until you are done reading. The call to deactivate() is
    irreversible.
  - Did you mix scanned input with line reading?\n
    As with any other stream, operator >> will mark the stream as failed
    if the operator fails to parse.
