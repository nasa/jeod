 * Define the JEOD class declaration macros JEOD_MAKE_SIM_INTERFACES and
 * and JEOD_DECLARE_SIM_INTERFACES.
 * All JEOD class definitions must invoke JEOD_MAKE_SIM_INTERFACES within the
 * body of the class. Corresponding invocations of JEOD_DECLARE_SIM_INTERFACES
 * Are made at file scope and in the context of the global namespace.
 *
 * In a Trick environment, these macros gives the Trick input processor,
 * the Trick checkpoint / checkpoint-restart facility, and the ICG-generated
 * io_src file for the header full visibility of the class's contents.
 * The intent is to provide the same capability outside the Trick.
