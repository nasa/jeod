# <file_comparison> can be:
#     "" (empty)            -- no comparison needed
#     ["file1","file2",...] -- list of specific files.  Note that a single file
#                              must still be in a list ["file1"]
#     "*"                   -- compare all committed files
#     any combination of filename and wildcards.

# <outcome> is optional.  Where specified, it provides the expected return
# code if the test is not expected to return 0.  Lack of specification is
# assumed a proxy for a return code 0.
